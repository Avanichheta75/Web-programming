HTML is made for people over the age of 21 to discover and discuss cocktail recipes.  Whether you have not had a drop since quarantine started, or you are unsure of what to get at the bar the first time you go back other than a “Bud Light”, our website will be a social media platform for friends and strangers alike to connect through cocktails.
